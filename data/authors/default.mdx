Hi, I’m glad you’re here!

This blog is my space to share interesting insights and ideas related to software engineering.

I graduated in Electronics and Telecommunication, and during my studies I discovered a true passion for programming. That passion led me to start my journey
as a Software Engineer in 2022, and since then I’ve been continuously learning, building, and exploring the world of software development.
